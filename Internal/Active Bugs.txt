1. BUG: clicking off board

	- Can execute Ability on these targets.
Cause:
	- ?
Solution:
	- Need more info

2. BUG: 2 active listeners
Problem:
	- ClassSelector scene
	- "There are 2 active listeners in the scene"
Cause:
	- GameObject called "Main Camera" in the root of the scene
	- GameObject called "Main Camera" (child of the player)
	- Both camera GOs have AudioListener components.
Solution:
	- Not a great way around needing two cameras, since we require:
		- A camera when the scene starts
		- The Player to be instantiated so they can have the class selection apply to them.
	- Take the AudioListener off of the camera in the root of the scene.
	- Can we eventually take AudioListener off of any Cameras? I'm not sure why we would need to have the Audio be centered around any camera.
